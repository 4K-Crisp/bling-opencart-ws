The upload folder contains all files for this module. 
You will notice that the folders are in the same structure as your Opencart installation.

1. Navigate to your opencart root folder using an FTP program
2. Upload the "catalog" & "admin" folder to your opencart installation folder
3. Go to your admin area in Extensions->Product Feeds and enable your REST API extension
   You have to fill the security key field (eg. 12345 or anything else)
   You have to use this key in your REST URLs, eg:
   http://example.com/orders/key/12345
   http://example.com/products/key/12345
